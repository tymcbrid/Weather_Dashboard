This application gives the user a dashboard for all current weather information. The application first accesses their location and pulls the current city name and forecast as well as a 5-day forecast below. When the user searches for a new city in the bar, all of the information on screen is replaced. Lastly, the user has a search history that can be clicked on to revisit a city and comes prepopulated with major cities in the US and EU.
